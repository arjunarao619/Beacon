## Features

- No Buttons: On enabling Alert Mode, Just a hard shake of your phone triggers emergency mode, sending your location to your trusted contacts. Beacon eliminates the need of navigating to the app in case of an emergency

- Direct yourself to landmarks: Ever wanted to find the nearest ATM, Hospital, or police station without the added complexity of navigating and typing in dedicated apps? Beacon directs you the nearest ATM, click hospital, or police station instantly, with just click of a button.

- Multiple Sources: Is Your GPS too rusty, but mobile data works just fine? Not a problem! Beacon brings together GPS, network provider, and WiFi to give you an accurate location.

- Predefined SMS Templates: Informing parents/guardians when we've reached somewhere is quite common. Beacon enables you to send quick messages using SMS without having to type anything at all. Just Select the message and voila!

- Discrete Notifications: You can also send location notifications without ringing up an alarm. Just touch the send Location button, or disable the alarm in the settings panel to send quite, stealthy notifications to your loved ones.

- Responsive User Interface: Beacon pinpoints your location to an accuracy of 50 meters on the map. Change map themes to your liking!
